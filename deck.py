class DeckModule():
	"""
	A deck module is basically anything that you can put into a slot of the
	robot.  Whether or not it's actually a 'smart' module, it can respond
	to particular commands.

	For example, even though a Trash module is an empty plastic box, it still
	can respond to a 'dispose' command.
