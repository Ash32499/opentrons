This repo ignores all compiled CSS files and SASS caches. To view most recent style updates install compass to compile.

```
$ cd app
$ compass compile
```
or

```
$ compass watch
```
if you are editing the styles directly.

### Run Server
Currently, to start the server you have to install python3 and run python file directly.

```
$ cd app
$ python3 main.py
```
