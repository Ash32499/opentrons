"""
This script takes a 15 nucleotide target sequence followed by a base pair
representing the receiver plasmid.

It outputs an OT-One protocol to assemble a TALEN protein with the pFusX
system, which provides a pre-plated library of plasmids and a database
of well positions for this script to query.

Input is a string representing an RVD sequence, whitespace optional, 
such as:

> NI NG NI HD HD NN NG HD NG NG NI NG NG NG NG

Or DNA, such as:

> ATACCGTCTTATTTT

Output is a JSON file which represents a protocol that can run on any
OT-One machine.
